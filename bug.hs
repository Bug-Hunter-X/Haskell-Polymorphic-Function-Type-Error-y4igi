This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function (`f`) with an argument that doesn't match the type signature. This can lead to a compile-time error if the type checker cannot infer a suitable type for the polymorphic function.  The error message will typically complain about a type mismatch or an inability to unify types.

```haskell
f :: a -> a
f x = x

g :: Int -> String
g x = show x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = f "hello" --Type error: f expected a single type, not string and int 
  putStrLn (g 5) --This line works fine
  putStrLn result
```
