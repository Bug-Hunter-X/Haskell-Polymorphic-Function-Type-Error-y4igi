The error is in how the polymorphic function `f` is used.  It's defined to accept and return any single type `a`, but the usage in `main` tries to apply it to both a String and an Int.  This is invalid.

To fix this, either constrain the usage of `f` to a single type or make `f` a more generalized function.  Here's a corrected version focusing on using `f` only with a String:

```haskell
f :: a -> a
f x = x

g :: Int -> String
g x = show x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = f "hello"  --Now this is correct
  putStrLn (g 5)
  putStrLn result
```

Alternatively, if you need `f` to work with multiple types, you would need to refactor other parts to ensure type consistency, and handle different types using type classes or other advanced techniques if it requires different logic based on data type.
